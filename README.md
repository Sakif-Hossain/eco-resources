# Sustainable Resources Locator - EcoResources

## 🎯 Project Overview

A web application that helps users find sustainable resources in their area including but not limited to recycling centers, compost drop-offs, zero-waste stores, community gardens, and bike repair stations.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

The application is build using Next.js + TS + Tailwind CSS. It is deployed in Versel for a smooth and fast CI/CD pipeline. For storing and creating new resources on the Map, I used SheetDB to use [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cUXVvXZDgAI_fMZUhdBP7Si8xvfb0wEf10TWmZXYvL0/edit?gid=0#gid=0) as a database and fetch the table as a JSON object which I later use to create the markers.
